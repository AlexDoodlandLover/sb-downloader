# `.sb` downloader

`.sb` downloader downloads Scratch 1, 2, or 3 projects (even unshared ones).

## Why

It is no longer possible to download projects as `.sb2` or `.sb` files from the Scratch 3 interface. The builtin asset viewer allows you to download assets from projects, a feature not yet possible in Scratch 3.
