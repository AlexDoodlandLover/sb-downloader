# `.sb` downloader

sb downloader downloads Scratch projects (even unshared ones) as either `.sb2` or `.sb3` files.

## Why

I thought it would be kinda cool to make this so I did. Scratch 3 broke a lot of projects so being able to export `.sb2` files to run in the offline editor isn't a bad thing. Scratch 3 doesn't let you export assets yet, so you could use this to easily extract them using its asset viewer.
