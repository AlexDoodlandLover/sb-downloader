# `.sb` downloader

`.sb` downloader downloads Scratch 1, 2, or 3 projects (even unshared ones).

## Why

I thought it would be kinda cool to make this so I did. It is no longer possible to download projects as `.sb2` or `.sb` files from the Scratch 3 interface. By [enabling the asset viewer](https://forkphorus.github.io/sb-downloader/?assets=1) you can also download assets from projects, a feature not possible in Scratch 3 (yet).
