# `.sb` downloader

`.sb` downloader downloads Scratch 1, 2, or 3 projects from [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (even unshared projects).

## Why

It is no longer possible to download projects as `.sb2` or `.sb` files from the Scratch 3 interface. Therefore, projects broken by Scratch 3 cannot be run in an older version of Scratch unless you already downloaded them. Additionally, `.sb` downloader's asset viewer allows you to easily extract assets from projects, which is not yet possible in Scratch 3's interface.
