# .sb downloader

sb downloader downloads Scratch projects as either .sb2 or .sb3 files. Ironically, it doesn't actually support .sb files (yet).

## Why

Scratch 3 broke many projects and does not allow you to export projects as `.sb2` files, even if the project was made in Scratch 2. sb downloader lets you download these projects as `.sb2` files so you can run and edit them in the offline editor.
